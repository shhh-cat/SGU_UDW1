Eating plenty of vegetables can help you ward off heart disease and stroke, control blood pressure, prevent some types of cancer, strengthen your immune system and provide many other “life saving benefits.”  However, if you are among the 9 out of 10 people who fail to eat at least 3-5 servings of GREEN vegetables every day, you clearly could use a convenient source of greens.  Bio Coffee is that source!  Bio Coffee contains wheatgrass, one of nature’s super foods, and consuming at least one cup of Bio Coffee per day can put you on the path to optimal health. ",
